# Slack

The public Slack team for BloodHound can be found [here](http://slack.specterops.io/). This is a great place to learn more, ask questions, or just lurk! A good number of the BloodHound engineering team hang out here and are generally willing to help out when they have some extra time.

# GitHub Issues

Posting a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/SpecterOps/BloodHound/issues), whether it's a bug report or feature request, can be a good way to help get some attention to any issues or features you may be looking for. It's helpful for us to do a quick search first before posting to ensure you're not posting a duplicate issue. Also, please ensure that due diligence is followed prior to opening to make sure that the issue you are seeing isn't a configuration or environment issue. Reducing the noise helps us focus efforts
on bigger impact improvements.
