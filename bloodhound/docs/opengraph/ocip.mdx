### Now That You Have OpenGraph, Show Us What You Can Do with It

BloodHound has always been more than a tool; it’s been a platform shaped by the community that uses it to break things better. From the earliest privilege escalation chains to cutting-edge cross-domain attack paths, some of the best BloodHound content hasn’t come from us. It’s come from you.

Now that OpenGraph is live in BloodHound 8.0, we’re throwing down a challenge: 
- Use it. 
- Abuse it. 
- Break new ground with it.

We’re inviting the community to submit writeups, talk proposals, and real-world research that shows what’s possible with OpenGraph. Whether you’re owning data lakes or MacBooks, getting to a production database via GitHub, or just building something weird that works, we want to see it!

Top submissions will get:
- All authors of **blog posts** on research involving OpenGraph will receive a BloodHound Challenge coin and swag in the mail.
- For **research talks** on OpenGraph accepted by a security conference with more than 200 attendees, we’ll have a special bonus. You can choose between any SpecterOps training class or a free trip to attend [SO-CON 2026](https://specterops.io/so-con/) (ticket, flight, and hotel included).

<Note>
Selected authors or researchers will be invited to participate in a SpecterOps webcast​

Maximum of 10 people per categories are eligible to receive this incentive award, at SpecterOps' discretion
</Note>

Submit your research using this [form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/bhe-opengraph-research).

Let’s see what kind of trouble you can get into!
