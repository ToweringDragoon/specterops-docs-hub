The OpenGraph library provides a list of projects created by BloodHound community members that extend the coverage of BloodHound utilizing OpenGraph.

Have you built a cool project using OpenGraph and want it featured here? Already got your project in the list and need to update something? Open a ["Library Change" issue](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/issues) on the BloodHound Docs repo and we'll get it added for you!

Submissions from the community will have a <Icon icon="people-group" color="#ffffff" size={18}/> icon next to them while those by SpecterOps employees will have a <SO_Icon_Inline size={18}/> SpecterOps icon.

**Description**

ADAttributeHound is an [OpenGraph](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//opengraph/overview) extension for BloodHound that exports Active Directory custom attributes as node properties. BloodHound ingestion will make the properties merge with existing nodes otherwise it creates new nodes. ADAttributeHound enables targeted attribute collection for SharpHound Enterprise and SharpHound CE, which has the flag `-CollectAllProperties`.

#### <SO_Icon_Inline size={22}/> ManagerOfHound

**Description**

ManagerOfHound is an OpenGraph extension for BloodHound that collect manager-subordinate relationships from Active Directory and exports them as custom "ManagerOf" edges for BloodHound ingestion.

Some organizations implement self-service portals where managers can control the user accounts of their subordinates (e.g. password resets). This can create implicit privilege escalation paths not captured by the default BloodHound edges. ManagerOfHound makes these hidden relationships visible through OpenGraph, enabling security teams to identify and assess novel attack paths in their environment.

#### <Icon icon="people-group" size={22}/> ProfileHound

**Description**

ProfileHound is a post-escalation tool that helps find and achieve red-teaming objectives by locating user profiles on machines. It builds a new edge called `HasUserProfile`, which determines if a user profile exists on a computer. This edge allows operators to make informed decisions about which computers to target for looting secrets.

ProfileHound collects information from the `\\<target>\C$\Users\` directory on domain machines and checks the SIDs for domain users. It keeps track of the created and last modified timestamps to add to the edge's properties.

<Accordion title="Credentials" icon={<SO_Icon />}>
#### <SO_Icon_Inline size={22}/> SecretHound

**Description**

SecretHound converts secret scanning results from various sources into a BloodHound OpenGraph format. You can read the associated blog [here](https://specterops.io/blog/2025/11/13/taming-the-attack-graph-a-many-subgraphs-approach-to-attack-path-analysis/). It leverages @p0dalirius's [bhopengraph](https://github.com/p0dalirius/bhopengraph) library.

This project's primary goal is to expand the graph quickly using a single edge: `ContainsCredentialsFor`. Currently, SecretHound will map secrets to 141 technology subgraphs (using the default `taxonomy/taxonomy.json` system). This translates to potentially 141 possible hybrid attack paths. It includes existing subgraphs accessible through the `kind` array values of: `AZBase` for Azure/Entra ID, `GHBase` for GitHub, and `GCPBase` for Google Cloud Platform. Generic secrets get mapped to an abstract `kind` (i.e., `StargateNetwork`) that is a catchall. Most of the testing was around git repositories.

**Supported Scanners:**
- GitHub Secret Scanning
- NoseyParker
- TruffleHog
- Nemesis
