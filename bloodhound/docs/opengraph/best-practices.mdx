# Introduction

This page collects best practices for creating [Graph Extensions](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main/./library) and tooling for OpenGraph.

# Creating a new OpenGraph extension

## Elements of a Complete Submission

This section lists the elements that are mandatory and nice-to-have in an OpenGraph extension submission.

### Mandatory

1. A Collector/Hound
    - A script that collects all information needed to populate the graph
    - The collector should create JSON that can be uploaded to BloodHound

1. Documentation on
    - Minimum system requirements to run the tool
        - OS
        - Software
        - Resources
    - How to install the collector
    - How to use the collector
        - Minimum permissions needed to collect the information
            - As a privileged user
            - As an unprivileged user
        - Command line options/switches
            - Examples of running the tool from the command line

### Nice to Have

1. Nodes and Edges Documentation (online)
    - Hosted wiki (e.g., GitHub) or
    - Markdown file in the repository
    - List of relevant information to document
        - General
        - Abuse Info
        - Remediation Info
        - OPSEC
        - References
        - Other fields as applicable

1. Optional API upload
    - Ability to upload the JSON output to a BloodHound instance via the [API](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//integrations/bloodhound-api/working-with-api) without user interaction
        - Requires an [API key](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//integrations/bloodhound-api/working-with-api#authentication)

1. Cypher Queries "Starter Pack"
    - Cypher Queries to help new users explore the new elements introduced to the Graph
    - Should be in the Custom Query JSON format for easy ingestion

1. Icon Definition Pack
    - Including a script to upload them. See [example](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//opengraph/custom-icons#example-with-python)
        - You can use a [Bearer Token](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//integrations/bloodhound-api/working-with-api#use-a-jwt-bearer-token) instead of an API key as this script will typically run only once.
        - Do not hardcode credentials; use place holder for users to modify.
