<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can I define my own icons in OpenGraph?">
Yes you can!
You can find all the details [here](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main/custom-icons)
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Can I delete data ingested via OpenGraph?">
Yes you can!

You can remove generic data by using one of the following three (3) options:

1. Cypher commands in the Explore UI
    - Requires `enable_cypher_mutations: true` in config. For more info [click here](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//manage-bloodhound/bh-config#enable-cypher-mutations)

2. Admin UI → Database Management page
    - The following checkboxes will be displayed
    - All Data
    - Active Directory Data
    - Azure Data
    - … X Data (there will be 0 or more checkboxes here that allow you to delete any data that had been ingested with a `source_kind` provided)
    - Sourceless Data (checking this box will delete all entities that do not have a kind that can be found in the `source_kinds` table.  You can observe the `source_kinds` your BloodHound instance is currently aware of by calling `GET api/v2/graphs/source_kinds`.)

3. API: `Clear-Database`
    - See the [OpenGraph API Page](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//opengraph/API) for more information

<Accordion title="How can I add my project to the OpenGraph library?">
Have you built a cool project using OpenGraph and want it featured here? Already got your project in the list and need to update something? Open a ["Library Change" issue](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/issues) on the BloodHound Docs repo and we'll get it added for you!

Submissions from the community will have a <Icon icon="people-group" color="#ffffff" /> icon next to them while those by SpecterOps employees will have a SpecterOps icon.
