By default any object that belongs to Tier Zero is marked as High Value. |
| Display Name            | The display name for the object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Object ID               | The object's security identifier (SID), a unique identifier in the directory.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ACL Inheritance Denied  | Identifies whether an object is allowing DACL inheritance to itself. Corresponds to the DACL_Protected security descriptor flag.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Admin Count             | Whether the object currently, or possibly ever has belonged to a certain set of highly privileged groups. For Active Directory nodes this is related to the AdminSDHolder object and the ProtectAdminGroups background task. Read more about that [here](https://specterops.io/resources/adminsdholder).                             |
| AdminSDHolder Protected | The authoritative security descriptor of this object matches that of the AdminSDHolder container and is therefore protected by it. AdminSDHolder is a security descriptor template that the ProtectAdminGroups background task stamps on protected objects.                                                                          |

| Description             | The contents of the description field for the object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
