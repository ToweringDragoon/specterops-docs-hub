AZOwner targets resources in AzureRM (for example [AZResourceGroup](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//resources/nodes/az-resource-group), [AZSubscription](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//resources/nodes/az-subscription), and [AZVM](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//resources/nodes/az-vm)) through role assignment called "Owner".

**Note: The edges [AZOwner](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//resources/edges/az-owner) and [AZOwns](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//resources/edges/az-owns) are distinct as they each apply their own distinct identity and access management platform (AzureRM and Entra ID respectively) with distinct mechanics, abuse primitives, and remediation steps.**

## Abuse Info

Everything a Contributor can do, with the addition of assigning rights to resources. Object ownership means almost all abuses are possible against the target object.

## Opsec Considerations

This depends on which abuse you perform, but in general Azure will create a log for each abuse action.
