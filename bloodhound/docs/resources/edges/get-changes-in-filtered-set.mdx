## Abuse Info

This edge is not abuseable by itself. When combined with [GetChanges](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//resources/edges/get-changes), BloodHound will create the abuseable edge [SyncLAPSPassword](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//resources/edges/sync-laps-password).

## Opsec considerations
