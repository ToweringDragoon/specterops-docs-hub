## Abuse Info
Domain Controllers store all Active Directory credentials and configurations for all principals in the domain. If an adversary gains administrative access to a Domain Controller, there are several options at their disposal for compromising domain identities and domain-managed systems. Please see the references section for more information.

## Opsec Considerations

Domain Controllers are universally among the most sensitive systems in Active Directory, and are often closely monitored by defenders. Attacks that rely on administrative access to a domain controller may produce artifacts that defenders will see as reliable and urgent indicators of compromise.
