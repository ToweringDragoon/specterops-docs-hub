## Abuse Info

The role can grant any other admin role to another principal at the tenant level. Activate the Global Admin role for yourself or for another user using PowerZure or PowerShell.

## Opsec Considerations

The Azure Activity Log will log who activated an admin role for what other principal, including the date and time.
