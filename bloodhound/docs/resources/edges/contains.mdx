## Abuse Info

Permissions on the parent of a child object may enable compromise of the child object through inherited ACEs or linked GPOs.

See the inbound edges on the parent object for details.

```
## Opsec Considerations
Creation and modification of ACEs will be logged depending on the auditing setup on Domain Controllers.
