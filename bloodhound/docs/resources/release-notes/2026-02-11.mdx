  ## User-Agent Flag

  Customize the User-Agent header used by AzureHound in all HTTP requests with the `--user-agent` [flag](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//collect-data/ce-collection/azurehound-flags#custom-user-agent).
  
  This is useful for evasion, debugging, or identification purposes without recompiling the binary.

  ## Last Sign-In from Azure

  Track user activity based on last successful sign-in timestamp collected from Entra ID.
  
  AzureHound [configuration](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//install-data-collector/install-azurehound/azure-configuration#grant-microsoft-graph-permissions) now supports collecting the `lastSuccessfulSignInDateTime` property for Azure users when the `AuditLog.Read.All` Microsoft Graph API permission is available.
  
  BloodHound displays this information for Azure nodes in the [Entity panel](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//analyze-data/explore/search#entity-panel).

  ## Updated Permissions for Saved Cypher Queries

  Edit Cypher queries that you've saved and shared with your organization.

  User and Power User roles can now edit [shared](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//analyze-data/explore/cypher-search#create-and-manage-queries) Cypher queries (no longer restricted to Admin users). This allows teams to collaborate more effectively by tailoring shared queries based on evolving needs.

  ## Cypher Rule Testing

  Verify your query before creating a [Cypher-based rule](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//analyze-data/privilege-zones/rules#cypher).
  
  A new **Run** button makes it more clear that you must run your Cypher query and preview the results before creating the rule.

  ## Consistent Certification Terminology

  <Badge shape="rounded" size="sm" color="purple">Enterprise</Badge>

  Use consistent language when managing certifications.
  
  The **Revoke** button on the [Certifications](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//analyze-data/privilege-zones/certification) tab has been renamed to **Reject** to align with the "Rejected" status filter.

  ## Zone Name in Object Information

  Quickly identify the name of the zone that an object belongs to instead of its position in the zone hierarchy.
  
  When you select an object on the graph or zone and label **Details** view, the name of the zone that the object belongs to now appears on the first line of the **Object Information** panel for clearer context.

<Update label="BloodHound" tags={["Fixed Issues"]}>

## Administration

{/*BED-7278*/} Resolved an issue where default admin configuration failed to populate missing fields when only some values were provided, which could prevent creating the default admin user.

## API

- {/*BED-7142*/} Resolved an issue where Active Directory entity API responses omitted the `kinds` array when counts were not included.
- {/*BED-7089*/} Resolved an issue where the [List asset group tag member by IDs](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//reference/asset-isolation/list-asset-group-tag-members-by-id) endpoint returned all members when filtering by a source kind with the `primary_kind` filter.
- {/*BED-6941*/} Resolved an issue where the path of the [Get API Spec](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//reference/api-info/get-api-spec) endpoint in the **API Explorer** and documentation was incorrect.

## Attack Path Analysis

<Badge shape="rounded" size="sm" color="purple">Enterprise</Badge>

- {/*BED-7149*/} Resolved an issue where the **Posture** page displayed an error after initial file ingestion.
- {/*BED-6961*/} Resolved an issue where long-running file ingestion jobs prevented analysis from running.

## Cypher

{/*BED-6696*/} Resolved an issue where `OPTIONAL MATCH` clauses in Cypher queries were treated as regular `MATCH` clauses, which caused incorrect results.

## OpenGraph

{/*BED-6995*/} Resolved an issue where the **File Ingest** logs did not surface warnings for partially successful OpenGraph data uploads. Warnings now display alongside errors in the **File Ingest** table to clarify partial failures.

## Zone Builder

- {/*BED-7196*/} Resolved an issue where clicking a rule's **View** option in the **Object** tab on the **Zone Builder** page didn't scroll the rule into view.
- {/*BED-7260*/} Resolved an issue where memory consumption was overestimated, which could cause graph queries to be prematurely cancelled.

</Update>

<Update label="AzureHound" tags={["Fixed Issues"]}>

{/*BED-7366*/} Resolved an issue where AzureHound could hang during device collection.

</Update>

<Update label="SharpHound" tags={["Fixed Issues"]}>

{/*BED-6776*/} Resolved an issue where SharpHound job details on the **Finished Jobs Log** displayed a *Status message unavailable* message for some clients that completed successfully.
