## Announcements

### Privilege Zones Early Access Update

For anyone who has not yet had the opportunity to try out our Privilege Zones early access, we're making it easier to make that change during this release! When we initially released the early access, we copied all of your existing selectors from Group Management into Privilege Zones. Of course, those objects tagged into Tier Zero change over time, so we're re-migrating all of your existing selectors to make it easier to try it out now. This will have no impact on any customers who have already enabled Privilege Zones.

We are hugely grateful for everyone who has tested out Privilege Zones so far and offered feedback, we've already begun incorporating those changes and look forward to continuing to do so over the coming months.

## BloodHound (v8.3.0)

### New and Improved Features

- **New modeling for AdminSDHolder** - Gain deeper insights into privilege escalation paths involving Tier Zero groups in your environment. A new [`ProtectAdminGroups`](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//resources/edges/protect-admin-groups) non-traversable edge connects the `AdminSDHolder` Active Directory container in each domain to all user, computer, and group nodes that it protects. The `ProtectAdminGroups` edge tracks the relationship between the `AdminSDHolder` security descriptor and protected nodes (requires SharpHound v2.8.0 or later).

  <Note>See the [AdminSDHolder: Misconceptions and Myths](https://specterops.io/resources/adminsdholder) blog post to learn more.</Note>

- **_[BHE Only]_ Privilege Zones Certification** - Interrupt automatic inclusion of additional objects into Privilege Zones by requiring manual certification of the additional objects. Requiring certification within a Zone will impact your findings in the Attack Paths page as you certify objects, as the paths to a Zone will change with your configurations. For example, a non-certified member of Domain Admins will generate a "Non-Certified Principal with Tier Zero Privileges" finding for the object until it has been removed from the group, or certified by an Administrator or Power User.

- **Privilege Zones History** - Audit and track changes to your Zones and Labels over time using the new **History** tab. This tab displays what type of change occurred, who made it, and when it happened. BloodHound retains 90 days of history from the last successful analysis operation.

- **_[BHE Only]_ Custom Glyphs for Privilege Zones** - Assign custom glyphs to your additional Privilege Zones to make different zones easier to distinguish on the **Explore** page.

  </Columns>

- **Sample Results for Selectors** - As a read-only user, view sample results for selectors directly within the **Selector Details** view to better understand selector impacts.

- **Selector Name Uniqueness** - To reduce the opportunity for confusion in the future, Selector names are now unique. Any existing selectors have been renamed with a numeral appended (i.e. `name_1`, `name_2`, etc) to support this new requirement.

- **_[CE Only]_ Privilege Zones enabled by default** - Start organizing your environment right away! Privilege Zones are now enabled by default on all new deployments. This change includes an expanded default definition of Tier Zero to align with SpecterOps' definition of the concept as documented in our [blog](https://posts.specterops.io/what-is-tier-zero-part-1-e0da9b7cdfca) and [GitHub](https://specterops.github.io/TierZeroTable/).

- **Finished Job Logs and File Ingest Details Panel** - Easily access detailed information about your data collection jobs and file ingests. Click on any job or ingest ID in the **Finished Jobs Log** or **File Ingest** pages to show detailed information, including status, status message, duration, user or client name, and more.

- **Finished Job Logs and File Ingest Filter** - Filter through manual and scheduled data collection job logs. The **Finished Jobs Log** and **File Ingest** pages now provide filters to help you identify specific jobs or ingests quickly. Common filters include status, date range, and user or client name. The **Finished Jobs Log** also includes a filter for data collected.

- **Improved Data Quality Environment Selector** - Find and select environments more easily. The environment selector on the **Data Quality** page now supports longer lists of active environments.

- **_[BHE Only]_ Logarithmic Scale for Posture Charts** - Enhance your chart readability on the **Posture** page by switching from linear to logarithmic scale. Activate this option to better visualize various scenarios, including minimal fluctuations, significant deviations, outliers, and anomalous or discrepant data points.
