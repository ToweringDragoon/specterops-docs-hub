## Announcements

### Zone Management Early Access is Live!
In preparation for BloodHound Enterprise's ability to support multiple tiers, the Group Management feature needed a complete overhaul. This release includes Early Access support for those interested in trying it out. We are adding considerable flexibility and improved ease of use to BloodHound with the Tier Management update, including how objects are tagged, providing better visibility into that process, and making querying for tagged objects much easier.

With Tier Management:
  - Querying for tagged objects in Cypher is much simpler, so no coalesce/split is needed! (All Cypher queries targeting tagged objects will need rewriting, we will introduce backwards compatibility in a future release).
  - Added support for Cypher selectors.
  - Selecting an OU will now tag all objects within (recursively).
  - Tier Management view provides information on which selectors are tagging an object.
  - BloodHound Enterprise now supports the Owned label!
  - And much more!

Please reach out to your TAM with any questions or feedback!

## BloodHound (v7.5.0)

### New and Improved Features

- **New Attack Path primitive: HasTrustKeys** - The `HasTrustKeys` edge indicates Attack Paths which exist as a result of a trust relationship between two domains. The trust keys shared between the domains can be leveraged to authenticate as the trust account and gain access to the trust account's domain.
- **Zoom in and highlight searched object** - The "Search Current Results" functionality of the Explore page has been updated to additionally zoom in on the object selected via the search panel, making it easier to find in the graph.
- **_[BHE Only]_ Added support for multiple Zones and Labels in the Privilege Zones Early Access feature** - BloodHound Enterprise customers may now create additional Zones and Labels for eventual support of the Privilege Zones feature. All BloodHound Enterprise customers may create additional zones, and may optionally choose to purchase the additional functionality to analyze those zones and track risk and remediation progress over time.
- **More accessible Data Deletion dialog** - Clarified the logic of the Database Management confirmation dialog, making it more accessible.
