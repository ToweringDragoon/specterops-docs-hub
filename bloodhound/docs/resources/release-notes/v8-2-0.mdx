## BloodHound (v8.2.0)

### New and Improved Features

- **Update to the Saved Queries UI, plus sharing support!** - The Saved Queries UI just got a massive upgrade and now supports sharing queries within your BloodHound environment! Additionally, this new UI supports searching and filtering, lets you enable auto-run support on click, and will let you import and export your saved queries for re-use!

</Frame>
- **Privilege Zones Functional and Workflow Improvements** - Work on the Privilege Zones early access continues as we near general availability of the functionality. We've added searching and filtering support to the detail view to more rapidly find specific objects, selectors, or to see only things relating to a specific environment. Several areas of the UI got an uplift to make disabled elements more clear, made previews more accurate, added some default sorting, and clarified some workflows.

- **Updates to traversable edges** - `ManageCA` and `ManageCertificates` edges are now marked traversable. With this change, these edges will appear in pathfinding filters, and will affect risk measurement in the Attack Paths page in BloodHound Enterprise, including the addition of several new Attack Path finding types.

- **More context on ADCS Entity Panels** - ADCS and the Attack Paths which result from the improper configuration of the service are incredibly complex. Within BloodHound, our goal is to demystify this complexity and to help users better understand the risks created by these configurations. To that end, we've introduced several new Entity Panel accordions to help provide additional clarity.
  - PKI hierarchy relationships on AIACA, RootCA, and EnterpriseCA objects.
  - Template tracking for EnterpriseCA and CertTemplate objects.
  - Trusted CA relationships for NTAuthStore objects.
  - ADCS escalation paths for Domain objects.

</Frame>
- **Improvements to ADCS pre-saved queries** - We've introduced new, pre-saved searches for ADCSESC5 and ADCSESC8 and clarified the searches that return data for ADCSESC6 and ADCSESC7. Although the queries for ESC6 and 7 previously existed, they were not explicit in identifying the relationship to the named escalation path.

- **Explore "Search" button clarified** - The "Search" button at the bottom of the Explore page searches only within the currently displayed results, making it quick to locate a specific object in your query output.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/release_notes/8_2_0/8_2_node_search.png" alt="Clarified Explore Search button in BloodHound v8.2.0"/>
</Frame>
- **Table view, compacted** - The Table layout added in v8.0.0 was a bit sparse, so we've tightened it up to display more data within the same screen space.
<Frame>
  <img src="/images/release_notes/8_2_0/8_2_compact_table.png" alt="Compacted table view in BloodHound v8.2.0"/>
</Frame>
- **_[BHE Only]_ Improved readability in Posture** - Any numbers over 1,000 in the Posture view should now include appropriate comma-separation for improved readability.

</Frame>
- **Entity Panel links are more distinct** - Updated formatting for links in Entity Panels to make them more distinct.
- **One logo to rule them all** - We love the BloodHound Enterprise dog-head logo, but the classic BloodHound dog is too good not to use across the entire product-line. For consistency of the BloodHound brand, we've moved both editions of BloodHound to consistently utilize the BloodHound dog.
