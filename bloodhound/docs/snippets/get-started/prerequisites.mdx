<Warning>
BloodHound Community Edition is a security auditing tool that was written to test the resilience of networks against attackers. Because this tool can equally be used for evil, some anti-malware and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions flag BloodHound and its components as **malware**.

If you encounter issues with downloads being blocked and files being prohibited from execution, you may have to shut off these protections. We recommend that you set up BloodHound on a dedicated machine so that your regular work environment remains protected. If you are planning to use BloodHound on a corporate network, please notify your Security Operations Center (SOC) ahead of time and ensure you have the required permissions to audit the network.

For legal and ethical reasons, you must never use BloodHound on systems you do not own or lack explicit permission to audit.
</Warning>
