The integration requires creating a user and assigning the **{role}** role.

<Steps>

    1.  Click **New**.

    1.  Enter required user details.
    
    1.  Click **Submit**.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign the required role">

  The user must have the **{role}** role to perform necessary actions, such as creating and updating ServiceNow tickets.

    1.  In the **Roles** related list, click **Edit**.

    1.  In the **Collection** list, select the **{role}** role and click **Add**.

    1.  Click **Save**.

        <Frame>
        {role === 'x_spop_security_in.app_admin' && (
            <img src="/images/integrations/service-now/sir/image30.png" alt="A view of the ServiceNow user interface showing the process of assigning the x_spop_security_in.app_admin role to a new service account user." />
        )}
        {role !== 'x_spop_security_in.app_admin' && (
            <img src="/images/integrations/service-now/vr/image2.png" alt="A view of the ServiceNow user interface showing the process of assigning the x_spop_specterops.app_admin role to a new service account user." />
        )}
        </Frame>
