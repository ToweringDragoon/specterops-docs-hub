## Server Requirements

### Hardware

| Resource | Minimum | Recommended | Large enterprise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Processor Cores** | 2 physical cores | 4 physical cores | 6 physical cores |
| **Memory** | 4GB RAM | 16GB RAM | 32GB RAM |
| **Hard disk space** | 1GB for logging | 5GB for logging | 20GB for logging |

**These recommendations should be considered a baseline and may need to be increased depending on the size and complexity of your environments.**

Where multiple collectors are deployed on a single host, scaling wll be necessary to maintain performance.
