<Note>BloodHound Enterprise customers can [create](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//analyze-data/privilege-zones/zones) additional zones to match their organization's security model. However, analyzing them requires the **Privilege Zone Analysis** feature (available for purchase). For more information, contact your sales representative.</Note>
