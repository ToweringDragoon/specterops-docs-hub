<Tip>
Extend BloodHound's analysis beyond Active Directory and Entra ID with additional data collectors. The [OpenGraph Library](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//opengraph/library) showcases collectors built by the community and SpecterOps employees for platforms like AWS, GitHub, Snowflake, and more.
