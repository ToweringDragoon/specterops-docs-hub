 **Automatically create new users on login**

  Enabling this option will have BloodHound create a new user on the first login with SSO (Just-In-Time). The user will be granted the role passed in the role claim if included, else the default role will be assigned.

 **Allow SSO Provider to modify roles**

  Enabling this option allows the SSO provider to modify user roles. This is accomplished by updating the role claim associated with the user account. The role will be updated on the next login. 
  To have this take effect immediately, disable then re-enable the user to invalidate current sessions and force a fresh login.

  See [User Role Mapping](#user-role-mapping) for role claim reference. 

5.  BloodHound will provide the URLs related to this new {auth_mode} provider integration. Please take a moment to verify that the **ACS URL** matches the **Single sign on URL** specified in the {auth_mode} application integration page during setup of the {auth_mode} integration.
