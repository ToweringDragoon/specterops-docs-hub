## User Role Mapping

First name, last name, and email are populated when the correct key/value pairs are provided in the {auth_mode} assertion payload.

<Warning>If omitted, fields default to the user's email.</Warning>

A role is applied when the role attribute/claim key is present and its value is a properly formatted BloodHound role.

Role values use the prefix `bh-` and are written in kebab-case. See [Administer Users and Roles](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//manage-bloodhound/auth/users-and-roles) for capabilities and scopes.

| **Role** | **Key Value** |
| --- | --- |
|Administrator|bh-administrator|
|Power User|bh-power-user|
|Auditor|bh-auditor|
|User|bh-user|
|Read Only |bh-read-only|
|Upload Only|bh-upload-only|

<Note>Only one role can be passed per user. If multiple roles are provided, BloodHound ignores them and applies the provider's default role.</Note>
