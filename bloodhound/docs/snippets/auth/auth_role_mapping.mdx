## User Role Mapping
First/last name and email are populated when the correct key/value are provided in the {auth_mode} assertion payload. If omitted, fields default to the user's email.

A role is applied when the role attribute/claim key is present and its value is a properly formatted BloodHound role.
Role values use the prefix `bh-` and are written in kebab-case.
See role definitions for capabilities and scopes: [Users and Roles](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//manage-bloodhound/auth/users-and-roles)

| **Role** | **Key Value** |
| --- | --- |
|Administrator|bh-administrator|
|Power User|bh-power-user|
|Auditor|bh-auditor|
|User|bh-user|
|Read Only |bh-read-only|
|Upload Only|bh-upload-only|

Only a single role value is accepted in the role claim. If multiple values are received, BloodHound ignores them and applies the provider’s default role. Ensure your IdP emits only one role value.
