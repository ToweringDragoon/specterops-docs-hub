After you configure the integration, Cortex XSOAR begins fetching BloodHound Enterprise attack path findings as incidents. Use the sections below to monitor ingestion, view incidents, and inspect details.

<Tip>See [install and configure](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//integrations/cortex-xsoar/configure) for setup steps and fetch interval settings.</Tip>

## Monitor ingestion and logs

You can view instance logs to confirm incidents are being fetched.
