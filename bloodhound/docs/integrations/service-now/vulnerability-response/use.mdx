The SpecterOps BloodHound Vulnerability Response Integration for ServiceNow provides a powerful solution for automating vulnerability management and remediation workflows based on attack path analysis.

After [installation and configuration](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//integrations/service-now/vulnerability-response/configure) is complete, you can start using the integration to view attack path data in ServiceNow's Vulnerability Manager Workspace. This section provides an overview of how to access and navigate the workspace to see the collected data from BloodHound Enterprise.

<Note>See the ServiceNow [documentation](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/xanadu/security-management/vulnerability-response/vuln-landing-page.html) for more information about using the Vulnerability Manager Workspace.</Note>
