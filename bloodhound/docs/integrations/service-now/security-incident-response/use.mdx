After [installation and configuration](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//integrations/service-now/security-incident-response/configure) are complete, the integration begins fetching attack path findings from the BloodHound Enterprise API. The integration creates a Security Incident Response (SIR) ticket for each attack path finding.
