The [Security Incident Response (SIR)](https://store.servicenow.com/store/app/5400757f1b45a610a85b16db234bcb85) integration for BloodHound Enterprise supports the following use cases:

- Create SIR ticketing workflows for BloodHound Enterprise attack path findings
- Integrate BloodHound Enterprise attack path findings into existing ticketing workflows
- Monitor identity vulnerabilities over time

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation and configuration process, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- Admin access to a ServiceNow instance with the [Security Incident Response (SIR) module](https://www.servicenow.com/docs/r/security-management/security-incident-response/install-and-configure-sir.html) installed and configured
- Access to the ServiceNow Store to install the BloodHound Enterprise app
- Admin access to a BloodHound Enterprise tenant
- A BloodHound Enterprise [non-personal API key/ID pair](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//integrations/bloodhound-api/working-with-api#create-a-non-personal-api-key%2Fid-pair) with the **Auditor** role

## Install the ServiceNow app

<InstallApp />

## Create an application user

<CreateAppUser role="x_spop_security_in.app_admin" />

## Configure the application

The integration provides a guided setup experience to connect to BloodHound Enterprise, filter attack path types, configure field mapping, and set the import schedule. Follow the steps below to complete the configuration.

<Steps>

  <ChangeAppScope app="Security Incident Response Integration with SpecterOps BloodHound" />

  <ConnectBloodHound app="Security Incident Response Integration with SpecterOps BloodHound" setup="Guided Setup" />

  <FilterAttackPathTypes app="Security Incident Response Integration with SpecterOps BloodHound" />

    <Step>

    ### Configure field mapping

    Field mapping allows you to specify how BloodHound Enterprise attack path finding fields map to ServiceNow SIR ticket fields. You can use the default mapping or customize it as needed.

    1.  Click **Get Started** in the _SpecterOps to ServiceNow Field Mapping_ section.

        <Frame>
        <img
            src="/images/integrations/service-now/sir/image12.png"
            alt="A view of the ServiceNow user interface showing the process of getting started with field mapping."
        />
        </Frame>

    1.  Click **Configure** to review the mapping. Update it if necessary, or use the default mapping.

        <Frame>
        <img
            src="/images/integrations/service-now/sir/image25.png"
            alt="A view of the ServiceNow user interface showing the default field mapping."
        />
        </Frame>

        The following table describes the default field mapping:

        | **SpecterOps BloodHound Fields** | **ServiceNow SIR Fields** |
        |----------------------------------|---------------------------|
        | id                               | correlation id            |
        | composite risk                   | risk score                |
        | description + remediation        | description               |
        | domain name + title + id         | short description         |
        | from principal                   | contact type              |
        | server url                       | external url              |

    1.  Click the <Icon icon="close" /> (close) icon.

    1.  Click **Mark as Complete**.

    </Step>

    <ConfigureImportSchedule app="Security Incident Response Integration with SpecterOps BloodHound" />
