This page covers common errors you may encounter when using the BloodHound Enterprise Splunk app, their possible causes, and steps to resolve them. 

<Tip>The app includes a built-in **BHE Integration Health** dashboard that you can use to  monitor the status of the integration and troubleshoot common issues. See the [BHE Integration Health](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//integrations/splunk/install#monitor-and-troubleshoot) section in the installation guide for details about accessing and using the dashboard.</Tip>

## List index out of range

- Causes:
  - API response does not contain the expected structure
  - Code accesses an empty list without validation

- Steps:
  - Identify the function in the error log table
  - Review recent API changes that could affect response shape
  - Add safe checks before indexing lists (e.g., verify length > 0)

## API authentication (401 Unauthorized)

- Causes:
  - Expired or invalid API token
  - Incorrect credentials in the BHE App configuration

- Steps:
  - Verify the API token value and expiry
  - Confirm correct credentials in the BHE App settings
  - If using OAuth, refresh the access token and restart the app

## Connectivity issues (Timeout/500)

- Causes:
  - Network problems between Splunk and the BHE API
  - API service downtime or high latency

- Steps:
  - Test connectivity with `ping` or `curl` from the Splunk host
  - Verify the BHE API endpoint is reachable from Splunk
  - Check provider status or maintenance notices

## Proxy errors

Example error:

```
HTTPSConnectionPool(host='demo.bloodhoundenterprise.io', port=443):
Max retries exceeded with url: /api/v2/posture-stats
(Caused by ProxyError('Cannot connect to proxy.',
NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x7f7c8b2b4a60>:
Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 113] No route to host')))
```

- Causes:
  - Incorrect proxy settings in Splunk
  - Proxy server unreachable or misconfigured

- Steps:
  - Verify Splunk proxy settings match your network configuration
  - Check the proxy server status and reachability from Splunk
  - Test connectivity with `curl -x <proxy> https://demo.bloodhoundenterprise.io`
