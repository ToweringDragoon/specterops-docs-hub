## Finished Jobs Log

Data collection clients log completed jobs to the **Finished Jobs Log**, which provides details about all collection activities that a client performs. This log is essential for monitoring and troubleshooting data collection jobs.

The **Finished Jobs Log** page provides a detailed log of each collection job, including:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| **ID** | A unique identifier for the client collection job |
| **Client** | The client that initiated the collection job |
| **Status** | The status of the collection job (e.g., complete, failed) |
| **Message** | A brief message providing additional context about the collection job |
| **Start Time** | The time when the collection job started |
| **Duration** | The time taken to process the collection job |
| **Data Collected** | The [type of data](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//collect-data/permissions) that the client is configured to collect |

## File Ingest Logs

When you perform an [ad-hoc data collection](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//collect-data/enterprise-collection/ad-hoc-collection) by uploading a SharpHound output .zip file, ingestion process details are logged on the **File Ingest** page.

You can use this page to monitor ingestion and ensure successful data processing. It shows the status of each file ingest operation, which can be helpful for viewing data upload history or troubleshooting data ingestion issues.

The **File Ingest** page provides a detailed log of each ingestion attempt, including:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **ID** | A unique identifier for the file ingest operation |
| **User** | The user who initiated the file ingest operation |
| **Status** | The current status of the file ingest operation (e.g., complete, failed) |
| **Message** | A brief message providing additional context about the file ingest operation |
| **Start Time** | The time when the file ingest was initiated |
| **Duration** | The time taken to process the file ingest operation |
| **File Information** | Details about the ingested file(s), such as file count and file name(s) |

<Steps>
  <Step title="View File Ingest logs">
  In the left menu, click **Administration** > **File Ingest**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the Details panel">
  Click the specific file ingest **ID** in the table to open the **Details** panel.

  <Tip>You can also click the <Icon icon="filter" /> icon to filter ingest IDs by status, data range, and user.</Tip>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Review the log entries">
  In the **Details** panel, review the log entries for the selected ID. Look for any errors or warnings that may indicate issues during the ingestion process.
  
  If a file failed to ingest due to format issues or data corruption, the log provides specific error messages to help you diagnose the problem.

  For example, the following log indicates a failed ingestion due to a schema validation error:
