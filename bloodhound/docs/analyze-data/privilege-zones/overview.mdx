Privilege Zones help you organize objects in your environment into logical groups based on their privilege and risk levels. Using Privilege Zones, you can monitor and maintain the security posture of tiered isolation models.

<Note>Privilege Zones is available under [early access](#early-access) and is not enabled by default.</Note>

## Key concepts

Review these key concepts before you explore Privilege Zones. You can find detailed explanations for each concept in the articles throughout this section.

| Concept           | Description                                                                                                                                      | Used in Risk Analysis |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :-------------------: |
| **Zone**          | A group of objects representing the hierarchy of control across all domains in an environment (based on access level)                            |           ✅           |
| **Label**         | A flexible way to categorize objects within a zone (or across zones) for easier searching and filtering                                          |           ❌           |
| **Selector**      | A rule that associates objects with zones and labels, based on object types, relationships (expansion), or Cypher queries                        |           ✅           |
| **Tagging**       | The process of associating objects with zones and labels using selectors                                                                         |           ✅           |
| **Certification** | _[BHE only]_ An optional process to interrupt automatic inclusion of additional objects in a zone by requiring manual certification of the additional objects |           ✅           |

Zones organize objects into a strict hierarchy. BloodHound analyzes how object privileges are assigned and where they can be escalated across your environment.

By default, BloodHound includes a **Tier Zero** zone that represents a set of objects with full control over an environment *and* any objects with control over those objects. See [Tier Zero: Members and Modification](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//get-started/security-boundaries/tier-zero-members) to learn more.

<Note>By default, you can [create up to two additional zones](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//analyze-data/privilege-zones/zones) to match your organization's security model. If you need to create more zones, contact your account manager.</Note>

If BloodHound detects an object in a lower-privileged zone controlling an object in a higher-privileged zone, it identifies it as a finding in the **Attack Paths** and **[Posture](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//analyze-data/posture-page)** pages. For example, if a Tier One user can control a Tier Zero server, BloodHound flags it as a violation of the privilege model.

This analysis helps you identify and remediate privilege escalation paths and misconfigurations that violate your security model.

## Features

The **Privilege Zones** page provides the following tabs:

* **Zones**: A group of objects that represent the hierarchy of control across all domains in an environment based on access level
* **Labels**: A flexible way to categorize a group of objects in a single zone (or across multiple zones) for easier searching and filtering
* **Certification** _[BHE only]_: An optional process to interrupt automatic inclusion of additional objects in a zone by requiring manual certification of the additional objects
* **History**: An audit log of changes made to your zones and labels over time

These tools enable further risk mitigation in your environments by highlighting the violations and misconfigurations in your tiered network model.
