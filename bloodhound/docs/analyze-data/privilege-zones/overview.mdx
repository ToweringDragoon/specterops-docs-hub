Privilege Zones help you organize objects in your environment into logical groups based on their privilege and risk levels. Using Privilege Zones, you can monitor and maintain the security posture of tiered isolation models.

<Note>The Privilege Zones feature is available under early access.</Note>

## Key concepts

The **Zone Builder** page provides tools for configuring and managing your Privilege Zones. Review the following key concepts to understand how Privilege Zones work and how to use them effectively:

| Concept           | Description |
| ----------------- | ----------- |
| **Zone**          | A group of objects that represents a hierarchy of control across identity providers and services, based on access level. An object can belong to only one zone at a time (the highest-priority zone that matches). |
| **Label**         | A flexible way to categorize objects for searching and filtering. An object can belong to multiple labels simultaneously. |
| **Certification** | <Badge shape="rounded" size="sm" stroke color="purple">Enterprise Edition</Badge> An optional review step that pauses automatic inclusion of newly matched objects in a zone until you certify them. |
| **History**       | An audit log of changes made to zones, labels, and related rules. |

Zones organize objects into a strict hierarchy. BloodHound analyzes how object privileges are assigned and where they can be escalated across your environment.

By default, BloodHound includes a **Tier Zero** zone that represents a set of objects with full control over an environment *and* any objects with control over those objects. See [Tier Zero: Members and Modification](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//get-started/security-boundaries/tier-zero-members) to learn more.

If BloodHound Enterprise detects an object in a lower-privileged zone controlling an object in a higher-privileged zone, it identifies it as a finding in the **Attack Paths** and **[Posture](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//analyze-data/posture-page)** pages. For example, if a Tier One user can control a Tier Zero server, BloodHound flags it as a violation of the privilege model.

This analysis helps you identify and remediate privilege escalation paths and misconfigurations that violate your security model.

## Object membership

Before working with Privilege Zones, it's important to understand how BloodHound assigns objects to zones and labels through the analysis process.

- **Object membership requires rule matching**: Objects are only assigned to a zone or label if they match at least one of the zone's or label's rules
- **Zone membership is exclusive to the highest-priority zone**: If multiple zone rules match an object, BloodHound assigns it to the highest-priority zone only
- **Objects can have multiple labels**: Unlike zones, an object can match multiple label rules simultaneously

Most changes to Privilege Zones affect object membership and require analysis to run before you can validate the results. Understanding when you can expect to see results helps you maintain your configuration and validate remediation efforts.

## Workflow

The following steps represent the general workflow for making changes and validating the results:

<Steps>
	<Step title="Configure settings">

    Make any necessary changes to your zones, labels, and rules on the **Zone Builder** page.

    </Step>

    <Step title="Save changes">

    Save your configuration changes to automatically trigger analysis for any settings that affect object membership.

    All changes that affect object membership require analysis to run before you can validate the results. Actions that require analysis include:

    - Creating a new zone or label with a rule definition
    - Creating, editing, or deleting a rule definition for an existing zone or label
    - Editing the details of a zone or label that has a rule definition
    - Deleting a zone or label that has a rule definition

	</Step>

	<Step title="Wait for analysis to complete">

    Check your [tenant status](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//collect-data/enterprise-collection/monitor#tenant-status) to monitor analysis progress. During analysis, BloodHound re-evaluates object membership against the updated configuration.

    <Note>Analysis may take several minutes to complete depending on the size of your environment. Until analysis finishes, the Zone Builder **Details View** and related metrics will not reflect your latest changes.</Note>

	</Step>
	<Step title="Validate the results">

    Validate that your configuration changes have the expected results:

    1. Navigate to the **Zone Builder** page and verify that the expected objects are now included in (or excluded from) the relevant zones and labels.
    1. Review the **Attack Paths** and **Posture** pages for new findings or changes in existing findings related to the updated zones and labels.

	</Step>
</Steps>

## Common issues

**I created a new zone rule but don't see any objects in the zone.**

- Analysis may still be running. Wait for it to complete before checking zone membership.
- The rule may not match any objects. Review the rule definition and test with known objects.
- Multiple zone rules may match the same objects. Check if another zone with higher priority is taking precedence for those objects.

**I updated a zone rule but don't see any changes.**

Analysis is required for rule updates to take effect. Check the analysis status and wait for completion.

**I deleted a zone rule and objects are still showing in the zone.**

- Other rules in the same zone may still match those objects. To see which rules are tagging a specific object, use the [object-based](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//analyze-data/privilege-zones/rules#method-2%3A-search-by-object-name-or-id) search method.
- Analysis may still be running. Wait for completion to see the final result.
