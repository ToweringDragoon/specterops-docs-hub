Certification is an optional process to interrupt automatic inclusion of additional objects in a zone based on [rule](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//analyze-data/privilege-zones/rules) expansion behavior by requiring manual certification of the additional objects. It allows administrators or power users to manually review and approve objects before they appear in privilege zones.

This process gives you control over zone membership and helps prevent unexpected additions from triggering false findings.

## Why use certification?

Without certification, BloodHound automatically includes objects in zones as soon as they match a rule's expansion criteria. This can create unexpected findings when objects are inadvertently added to privileged groups.

For example, if a new user is added to the Domain Admins group, BloodHound immediately tags them to the **Tier Zero** zone and generates attack path findings for that user.

In the preceding example, certification solves this problem by requiring manual approval before objects are fully recognized within a zone. During the certification process, BloodHound still identifies the object's relationship to the zone but generates a "Non-Certified Principal with Tier Zero Privileges" finding instead of standard attack path findings.

This gives you time to review whether the object should remain in the zone or if its group membership was a mistake.

<Note>BloodHound supports certification for zones only.</Note>

## How certification works

When you enable certification for a zone:

1. Objects that match the zone's rules enter a pending state
2. BloodHound generates findings indicating the objects require certification
3. Administrators or power users review pending objects in the **Certification** tab
4. Once certified, objects are fully recognized in the zone and BloodHound generates standard findings
5. Alternatively, you can remove objects from privileged groups to prevent zone membership

You can configure certification requirements at the zone level (to affect all rules) or at the individual [rule](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//analyze-data/privilege-zones/rules) level, giving you flexibility in managing object approvals.

## Manage certifications

The **Certifications** tab in the **Zone Builder** page allows administrators and power users to review, approve, or revoke certifications for objects in zones where manual certification has been configured.

<Note>
  * You can certify or revoke certification only for objects in zones where certification is enabled.
  * Objects appear in the certification queue only when their [rules](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//analyze-data/privilege-zones/rules) have **Automatic Certification** turned off.
</Note>

To manage certifications:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Certifications tab">
    Navigate to the **Privilege Zones** > **Certifications** tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Filter certifications">
  Use one of the following methods to filter certifications:
  
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="By Status" icon="circle-check">
        Click the status drop-down menu and choose **Pending**, **User Certified**, **Automatic Certification**, or **Rejected** to view relevant certifications.

        <Note>Actions are only available for certifications that require manual approval. You cannot approve or revoke **Automatic Certifications**.</Note>

        />
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="By Environment" icon="globe">
        Click the environment drop-down menu and select the desired environment to view its certifications.

         />
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="By Search" icon="search">
        The **Certifications** tab also provides a search box and filters to help you identify specific certifications.

          style={{ width:"50%" }}
        />
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete the certification action">
    1. Use the checkboxes to select one or more objects.

    2. Click **Approve Certification** or **Revoke Certification** as needed.

    3. *(Optional)* Add a note to document the reason for your action.

       * Click **Skip Note** to complete the certification action without a note
       * Click **Cancel** to exit without completing the certification action
