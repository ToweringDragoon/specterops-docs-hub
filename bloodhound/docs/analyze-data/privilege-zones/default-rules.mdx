BloodHound provides a set of rules by default that place known critical objects into the default Tier Zero zone according to SpecterOps best practices.

<Note>You can disable some of these rules, but not all of them.</Note>

| Rule                                    | Disable-able | Type          | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Account Operators                       | TRUE         | DC group      | The Account Operators group has GenericAll in the default security descriptor on the AD object classes: User, Group, and Computer. That means all objects of these types will be under full control of Account Operators unless they are AdminSDHolder Protected. Not all Tier Zero objects will be AdminSDHolder Protected typically, as not all Tier Zero objects will be included in Protected Objects. This means Account Operators members have a path to compromise Tier Zero most often.<br /><br /><br /><br />It is possible to delete all GenericAll ACEs for Account Operators on Tier Zero objects. To protect future Tier Zero objects, one would have to either remove the Account Operators ACE from the default security descriptors or implement a process of removing the ACEs as Tier Zero objects are being created. However, we recommend not using the group and classifying it as Tier Zero instead. |
| Administrator                           | FALSE        | AD user       | The built-in Administrator account has admin access to DCs by default and is therefore Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Administrators                          | FALSE        | DC group      | The Administrators group has full control over most of AD's essential objects and are inarguably part of Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| AdminSDHolder                           | FALSE        | AD container  | The permissions configured on the AdminSDHolder container are a template that will be applied on Protected Objects by the ProtectAdminGroups background task at a default interval of every hour. Control over AdminSDHolder means you have control over the Protected Objects, which include Tier Zero groups such as Domain Admins and their transitive members. The AdminSDHolder container is therefore a Tier Zero object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| AIA CA (AD object)                      | TRUE         | AD object     | The AIA CA objects may represent offline enterprise CAs or cross CAs. In such cases, deleting the AIA CA object would cause certificates, potentially of Tier Zero principals, to lose trust. We therefore recommend to treat AIACAs as Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Application Administrator               | TRUE         | Entra ID role | The Application Administrator role can control tenant-resident apps. This includes creating new credentials for apps, which can be used to authenticate the tenant as the app's service principal and abuse the service principal privileges. The role is therefore considered Tier Zero if the tenant contains any Tier Zero service principals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Azure tenant object                     | FALSE        | Entra ID role | An attacker with control of the Tenant Root Object has control of all identities, applications, roles, and devices that reside in that tenant. Further, control of the Tenant Root Object enables an attacker to gain control of all Azure Resource Manager subscriptions that trust the tenant. This object is therefore considered Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| AZUREADSSOACC object                    | TRUE         | Entra ID role | Microsoft automatically creates the AZUREADSSOACC account when enabling Seamless SSO. When configured for Seamless SSO, this object can modify any synced object within an Azure environment, granting significant control over the organization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Backup Operators                        | FALSE        | DC group      | The Backup Operators group has the SeBackupPrivilege and SeRestorePrivilege rights on the domain controllers by default. These privileges allow members to access all files on the domain controllers, regardless of their permission, through backup and restore operations. Additionally, Backup Operators have full remote access to the registry of domain controllers. To compromise the domain, members of Backup Operators can dump the registry hives of a domain controller remotely, extract the domain controller account credentials, and perform a DCSync attack. Alternative ways to compromise the domain exist as well. The group is considered Tier Zero because of these known abuse techniques.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Cert Publishers                         | TRUE         | AD group      | The Cert Publishers group has full control permissions on root CA and AIA CA objects. This enables an attacker to add or remove certificates for these objects, which are trusted throughout the AD forest. As certificate authentication requires the certificate to chain up to a trusted root CA, an attacker could prevent successful authentication for AD accounts and disrupt Tier Zero operations. The group is therefore Tier Zero.<br /><br />In some environments, the group also has full control over the NTAuth store. In that scenario, the group can take over the forest by adding a forged root certificate, making it trusted for NTAuth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Certificate template                    | TRUE         | AD object     | Control over a certificate template enables the ADCS ESC4 attack and Tier Zero takeover if the template is published to a CA trusted in the NTAuth store and that chains up to a trusted root CA. There are default templates that meet this requirement; others remain unpublished. A template cannot be used if it is not published, making control over an unpublished object less concerning. However, if it is ever published, it becomes a risk.

One option is to dump the private key of the CA and craft a 'golden certificate' as a target user. This attack can be prevented by protecting the private key with hardware. Alternatively, the attacker can publish any template, modify pending certificate requests, and issue denied requests, which typically also enable a takeover of Tier Zero.

The group is therefore Tier Zero.<br /><br />If Exchange is configured in the AD split model, then this group has no compromising permissions and can be treated as non-Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Global Administrator                    | FALSE        | Entra ID role | The Global Administrator role is the highest privilege role in Entra ID and inarguably part of Tier Zero. It can do almost anything, and grant permission to do the things it cannot do.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Intune Administrator                    | TRUE         | Entra ID role | The Intune Administrator role has permission to execute scripts locally on Entra-managed devices. The role has therefore a potential attack path to Tier Zero through Entra-managed devices used by Tier Zero principals. Furthermore, the Intune Administrator role can manage Conditional Access, which can be abused to lower the security of Tier Zero or prevent the operability of Tier Zero. The role is therefore considered Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Key Admins                              | FALSE        | AD group      | The Key Admins group has write access to the msds-KeyCredentialLink attribute on all users (not AdminSDHolder Protected when the PDCe runs an OS earlier than Server 2019 or unless the ProtectAdminGroups task is manually forced) and on all computers in the AD domain. This enables the group to compromise all these principals through Shadow Credentials attacks. The group is therefore considered Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Knowledge Administrator                 | TRUE         | Entra ID role | The Knowledge Administrator role can control non-role-assignable groups. If any non-role-assignable group has compromising permissions over a Tier Zero asset (e.g. Contributor on a domain controller Azure VM), then the Knowledge Administrator role can add arbitrary principals to the given group and compromise Tier Zero. If no non-role-assignable group has compromising permissions over a Tier Zero asset, then there is no attack path to Tier Zero from the Knowledge Administrator role. It therefore depends on the usage of non-role-assignable groups whether the role should be considered Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| KRBTGT objects                          | TRUE         | AD user       | The krbtgt's credentials allow one to create golden ticket and compromise the domain. Therefore, if you obtain the credentials of this account, then you can authenticate as any Tier Zero user. However, there is currently no known privilege on the object to obtain the Kerberos keys or to compromise the account in any other way. When you reset the password of krbtgt, AD will ignore your password input and use a random string instead. So, the reset password privilege does not work for a compromise. An attacker could use the reset password privilege to harm Tier Zero, as a double password reset causes all Kerberos TGTs in the domain to become invalid. So, since control over the account can harm Tier Zero, and there is no reason for delegating control to non-Tier Zero, the krbtgt is Tier Zero.                                                                                                                   |
| NTAuth store                            | TRUE         | AD object     | The NTAuth store is a security dependency for Tier Zero. A certificate that impersonates any user in AD must chain up to a trusted root CA and be issued by a CA trusted by the NTAuth store. With control over a root CA and the NTAuth store, an attacker can make an attacker-controlled root CA certificate meet these requirements and issue certificates as anyone, taking over Tier Zero. Control over the NTAuth store alone may be sufficient to disrupt Tier Zero operations, as the attacker can delete CA certificates that Tier Zero principals or systems rely on for authentication. The NTAuth store is therefore Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Read-Only Domain Controllers            | TRUE         | AD computer   | An attacker with control over a RODC computer object can compromise Tier Zero principals. The attacker can modify the msDS-RevealOnDemandGroup and msDS-NeverRevealGroup attributes of the RODC computer object such that the RODC can retrieve the credentials of a targeted Tier Zero principal. The attacker can obtain admin access to the OS of the RODC through the managedBy attribute, from where they can obtain the credentials of the RODC krbtgt account. With that, the attacker can create a RODC golden ticket for the target principal. This ticket can be converted to a real golden ticket as the target has been added to the msDS-RevealOnDemandGroup attribute and is not protected by the msDS-NeverRevealGroup attribute. Therefore, the RODC computer object is Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                |

With control over a root CA and the NTAuth store, an attacker can make an attacker-controlled root CA certificate meet these requirements and issue certificates as anyone, taking over Tier Zero. Control over a root CA alone may be sufficient to disrupt Tier Zero operations, as the attacker can delete root CA certificates that Tier Zero principals or systems rely on for authentication. Root CA objects are therefore Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Schema Admins                           | FALSE        | AD group      | The Schema Admins group has full control over the AD schema. This allows the group members to create or modify ACEs for future AD objects. An attacker could grant full control to a compromised principal on any object type and wait for the next Tier Zero asset to be created, to then have a path to Tier Zero. This attack could be remediated by removing any unwanted ACEs on objects before they are promoted to Tier Zero, but we recommend considering the group as Tier Zero instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Security Administrator                  | TRUE         | Entra ID role | The Security Administrator role has access to Live Response API (if not disabled) with permission to execute scripts locally on Entra-managed devices. The role has therefore a potential attack path to Tier Zero through Entra-managed devices used by Tier Zero principals. Furthermore, the Security Administrator role can manage Conditional Access, which can be abused to lower the security of Tier Zero or prevent the operability of Tier Zero. The role is therefore considered Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Server Operators                        | TRUE         | DC group      | The Server Operators group has local privileges on the domain controllers and perform administrative operations as creating backups of all files. The group can log on locally on domain controllers by default.<br /><br />It is feasible to remove the logon privilege from the group on the domain controllers, such that the group has no known abusable path to Tier Zero. However, the local privileges are considered security dependencies for the domain controllers, and the groups are therefore considered Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
