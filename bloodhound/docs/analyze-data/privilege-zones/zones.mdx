Zones define hierarchical privilege levels in your environment based on a tiered administration model. The most common tiering model is [Microsoft's Enterprise Access Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/privileged-access-workstations/privileged-access-access-model). 

BloodHound uses zones to measure risk and detect violations. Each zone has a specific tier level (**Tier Zero** is the default and highest).

### Edit a zone

Editing options depend on which edition of BloodHound you're using. In BloodHound Enterprise, you can edit all zone properties. In BloodHound Community Edition, you can edit the default **Tier Zero** zone description.

To edit a zone, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select a zone">
   1. In the left menu, click **Privilege Zones**.

   1. By default, the **Tier Zero** zone is pre-selected. To edit a different zone in BloodHound Enterprise, select the zone you want to edit.
   
      <Note>**Tier Zero** is the only available zone for BloodHound Community Edition.</Note>

      <img
        src="/images/privzones/edit-zone.png"
        alt="A view of the Zone Builder edit zone page in BloodHound Community Edition"
      />

    1. Click **Edit Zone**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Edit the zone">

   Modify one of the available fields.

   For example, you can modify the zone's name, description, [certification](https://github.com/SpecterOps/bloodhound-docs/blob/main//analyze-data/privilege-zones/certification) and analysis settings, and custom glyph.

   <Note>In BloodHound Community Edition, you can edit the default **Tier Zero** zone description only.</Note>

   You can also change the zone's hierarchical position by using the <Icon icon="grip-vertical" iconType="solid" /> (vertical grip control) in the **Zone Order** panel to reorder it.

   Zone order is defined by privilege level, with the highest-privileged zone at the top.
