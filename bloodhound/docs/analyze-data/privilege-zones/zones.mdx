Zones define hierarchical privilege levels in your environment based on a tiered administration model. The most common tiering model is [Microsoft's Enterprise Access Model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security/privileged-access-workstations/privileged-access-access-model). 

BloodHound uses zones to measure risk and detect violations. Each zone has a specific tier level (**Tier Zero** is the default and highest). You can create multiple zones (e.g., Tier One, Tier Two) to match your security model.

The **Zones** tab offers two views:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Summary View">
  The **Summary View** shows zone names, rule counts, member count, and their hierarchy relative to other zones (the top zone is most critical).

      style={{ width:"100%" }}
    />
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Detail View">
  The **Detail View** lists every rule and member that each rule pulls into the associated zone.

  Use the **Domain Selector** beside the **Detail View** to filter the view by specific domains in your environment.
