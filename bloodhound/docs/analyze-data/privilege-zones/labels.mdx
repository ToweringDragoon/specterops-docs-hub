Labels let you tag groups of objects for easier searching and filtering. For example, you can label compromised assets with the default **Owned** label to quickly identify attack paths from non-compromised to compromised assets in your environment.

The **Owned** label represents objects that have been compromised in your environment. You can tag objects with the **Owned** label using rules or manually in the graph.

<Note>Unlike zones, BloodHound does not use labels in risk analysis—they're designed to help you organize and query your data.</Note>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Details View">
  The **Details View** displays all rules configured for the selected label and the objects that they pull into the label (organized by node type). Use the dropdown menus to filter the view by specific zones, identity providers, and services in your network environment.

  Select a rule or object to display more details in the right panel, including:
  
  - Rule definition and Cypher query
  - Object properties and relationships

  <Note>BloodHound displays objects for enabled rules only. To view objects related to a disabled rule, you must re-enable it.</Note>

### Create a label

<Badge shape="rounded" size="sm" stroke color="purple">Enterprise Edition</Badge>

You can create custom labels to categorize objects based on any criteria relevant to your environment, such as business function, sensitivity level, or compliance requirements.

For example, you might create a label for PCI-scoped systems to quickly identify attack paths from non-PCI to PCI environments.

Creating a label involves configuring the label details and defining a rule.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Zone Builder page">
  In the left menu, click **Privilege Zones** > **Labels** > **Create Label**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure initial label details">
  Enter all relevant information about the label:

  | Field                | Required?    | Description                                                                                   |
  |----------------------|:------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Name                 | Yes          | A unique name for the label (e.g., PCI)                                                       |
  | Description          | No           | A brief description of the label's purpose and scope (e.g., PCI assets)                       |

      style={{ width:"70%" }}
    />

  </Step>

  <Step title="Define a rule">
  Click **Define Rule** to save your new label and continue on to define the objects to include in the label.

  <RuleWarning/>

  When defining a rule during the label creation process, provide the following information:

  | Field                  | Required?          | Description                                                                                   |
  |------------------------|:------------------:|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Name                   | Yes                | A unique name for the rule (e.g., PCI)                                                        |
  | Description            | No                 | A brief description of the rule's purpose and scope (e.g., PCI assets)                        |
  | Rule Type              | Yes                | The type of rule to use (e.g., Object ID or Cypher)                                           |
