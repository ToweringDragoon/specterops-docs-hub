Privilege Zones has two tabs: Tiers (Zones) and Labels. Zones allow the logical separation of objects into three unique hierarchical groups according to the structure of your environment. Labels are a flexible tool to categorically bucket different objects. Together, these tools enable further risk mitigation in your environments by highlighting the violations and misconfigurations to your customized network model.

Zones and Labels each offer two views: **Summary** and **Detail**. Use the view selector (drop-down) in the UI to toggle between them.
- **Summary** shows the zone/label name, selector count, object count, and, for Zones, their hierarchy (the top zone is most critical).
- **Detail** lists every selector and the objects that each selector pulls into the chosen zone or label.

/>

4. Click "Define Selector" to save your new Privilege Zone and continue on to define the objects to include in the zone

## Labels

### Creating a Label

1. Select "Create Label"
2. Add a name and an optional description
3. Click "Define Selector" to save the label

## Selectors

Zone Selectors provide a logical method of ensuring objects appear in the appropriate zone using either a Cypher query or by searching for an object ID. **If an object has been added to multiple Zones, the most critical zone in your defined hierarchy will take precedence.**

Label Selectors are a flexible method of tagging objects in the environments. Objects can have multiple labels, and those labels are searchable and filterable using Cypher in the Explore page. The process and screens for creating and editing label selectors is the same as creating or editing zone selectors.

Any changes made to a selector will take effect on the next analysis.

  style={{ width:"53%" }}
/>

### Defining a Selector

If you start defining a selector via the zone creation process, skip to step 2.

1. From the Zone or Labels tab, select "Create Selector"
2. Provide a name
3. Optionally add a description to explain to others on your team, including yourself, the purpose of the Selector
4. Choose a selector type: Cypher or object ID
5. If using Cypher:
   1. Enter the Cypher query into the "Cypher Search" box
   2. To see the sample results, click "Update Sample Results" above the Cypher query box. The first 200 sample results will populate the list to the right
   3. Optionally, click "View in Explore" to pivot to the explore page and view the full Cypher query results
6. If using object ID
   1. Type in the blank to search for an object
   2. Select that object to add to the list
7. Adding the following object types will automatically include (→) more objects according to the definition below
   1. OU/Container → All objects contained in the OU/container
   2. Group → All objects with membership in the Group
   3. AZResourceGroup/AZSubscription → All objects contained in the RG/Sub
   4. AZGroup → All objects with membership in the group
   5. AZRole → All objects with role assignments (or eligibility)
8. Click "Save" to finalize the creation of the selector

Selectors can be enabled or disabled by editing the selector.

### Deleting a Selector

### Predefined Selectors

BloodHound provides a set of selectors by default that places known critical objects into Tier 0 according to SpecterOps best practices. Some of these selectors can be disabled while others cannot.

| Selector                                | Disable-able | Type          | Reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Account Operators                       | TRUE         | DC group      | The Account Operators group has GenericAll in the default security descriptor on the AD object classes: User, Group, and Computer. That means all objects of these types will be under full control of Account Operators unless they are protected with AdminSDHolder. Not all Tier Zero objects will be protected with AdminSDHolder typically, as not all Tier Zero objects will be included in Protected Accounts and Groups. This means Account Operators members have a path to compromise Tier Zero most often.<br /><br /><br /><br />It is possible to delete all GenericAll ACEs for Account Operators on Tier Zero objects. To protect future Tier Zero objects, one would have to either remove the Account Operators ACE from the default security descriptors or implement a process of removing the ACEs as Tier Zero objects are being created. However, we recommend not using the group and classifying it as Tier Zero instead. |

Control over AdminSDHolder means you have control over the Protected Groups (and their members) and Users, which include Tier Zero groups such as Domain Admins. The AdminSDHolder container is therefore a Tier Zero object.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Application Administrator               | TRUE         | Entra ID role | The Application Administrator role can control tenant-resident apps. This includes creating new credentials for apps, which can be used to authenticate the tenant as the app's service principal and abuse the service principal privileges. The role is therefore considered Tier Zero if the tenant contains any Tier Zero service principals.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Azure tenant object                     | FALSE        | Entra ID role | An attacker with control of the Tenant Root Object has control of all identities, applications, roles, and devices that reside in that tenant. Further, control of the Tenant Root Object enables an attacker to gain control of all Azure Resource Manager subscriptions that trust the tenant.

The group is therefore Tier Zero.<br /><br />In some environments, the group also has full control over the NTAuth store. In that scenario, the group can take over the forest by adding a forged root certificate, making it trusted for NTAuth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Enterprise CA Computers                 | TRUE         | AD computer   | Enterprise CAs can by default issue certificates that enable authentication as anyone, thereby allowing takeover of Tier Zero. An attacker with admin rights on an enterprise CA can obtain a certificate as any user in different ways. One option is to dump the private key of the CA and craft a 'golden certificate' as a target user. This attack can be prevented by protecting the private key with hardware. Alternatively, the attacker can publish any template, modify pending certificate requests, and issue denied requests, which typically also enable a takeover of Tier Zero. Enterprise CA computer objects are therefore Tier Zero.<br /><br />If the enterprise CA certificate is removed from the NTAuth store, then certificates from this CA cannot be used for domain authentication, thus preventing a Tier Zero takeover.                                                                                             |
| Enterprise Domain Controllers           | FALSE        | DC object     | There are no known ways to abuse membership in this group to compromise Tier Zero. However, the GetChangesAll privilege is considered a security dependency that should only be held by Tier Zero principals. Additionally, control over the group allows one to impact the operability of Tier Zero by removing domain controllers from the group, which breaks AD replication. The group is therefore considered Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The compromising permission is write access to the AltSecurityIdentities attribute, which allows an attacker to add an explicit mapping for the user for domain authentication. Typically, some Tier Zero users inherit permissions from the domain. The group is therefore Tier Zero.<br /><br /><br /><br />The group can only be treated as non-Tier Zero if all Tier Zero users are protected from this compromising permission.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Intune Administrator                    | TRUE         | Entra ID role | The Intune Administrator role has permission to execute scripts locally on Entra-managed devices. The role has therefore a potential attack path to Tier Zero through Entra-managed devices used by Tier Zero principals. Furthermore, the Intune Administrator role can manage Conditional Access, which can be abused to lower the security of Tier Zero or prevent the operability of Tier Zero. The role is therefore considered Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Knowledge Administrator                 | TRUE         | Entra ID role | The Knowledge Administrator role can control non-role-assignable groups. If any non-role-assignable group has compromising permissions over a Tier Zero asset (e.g. Contributor on a domain controller Azure VM), then the Knowledge Administrator role can add arbitrary principals to the given group and compromise Tier Zero. If no non-role-assignable group has compromising permissions over a Tier Zero asset, then there is no attack path to Tier Zero from the Knowledge Administrator role. It therefore depends on the usage of non-role-assignable groups whether the role should be considered Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| KRBTGT objects                          | TRUE         | AD user       | The krbtgt's credentials allow one to create golden ticket and compromise the domain. Therefore, if you obtain the credentials of this account, then you can authenticate as any Tier Zero user. However, there is currently no known privilege on the object to obtain the Kerberos keys or to compromise the account in any other way. When you reset the password of krbtgt, AD will ignore your password input and use a random string instead. So, the reset password privilege does not work for a compromise. An attacker could use the reset password privilege to harm Tier Zero, as a double password reset causes all Kerberos TGTs in the domain to become invalid. So, since control over the account can harm Tier Zero, and there is no reason for delegating control to non-Tier Zero, the krbtgt is Tier Zero.                                                                                                                   |
| NTAuth store                            | TRUE         | AD object     | The NTAuth store is a security dependency for Tier Zero. A certificate that impersonates any user in AD must chain up to a trusted root CA and be issued by a CA trusted by the NTAuth store. With control over a root CA and the NTAuth store, an attacker can make an attacker-controlled root CA certificate meet these requirements and issue certificates as anyone, taking over Tier Zero. Control over the NTAuth store alone may be sufficient to disrupt Tier Zero operations, as the attacker can delete CA certificates that Tier Zero principals or systems rely on for authentication. The NTAuth store is therefore Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

The role is therefore considered Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Read-Only Domain Controllers            | TRUE         | AD computer   | An attacker with control over a RODC computer object can compromise Tier Zero principals. The attacker can modify the msDS-RevealOnDemandGroup and msDS-NeverRevealGroup attributes of the RODC computer object such that the RODC can retrieve the credentials of a targeted Tier Zero principal. The attacker can obtain admin access to the OS of the RODC through the managedBy attribute, from where they can obtain the credentials of the RODC krbtgt account. With that, the attacker can create a RODC golden ticket for the target principal. This ticket can be converted to a real golden ticket as the target has been added to the msDS-RevealOnDemandGroup attribute and is not protected by the msDS-NeverRevealGroup attribute. Therefore, the RODC computer object is Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                |
| Root CA object                          | TRUE         | AD object     | A root CA is a security dependency for Tier Zero. A certificate that impersonates any user in AD must chain up to a trusted root CA and be issued by a CA trusted by the NTAuth store. With control over a root CA and the NTAuth store, an attacker can make an attacker-controlled root CA certificate meet these requirements and issue certificates as anyone, taking over Tier Zero. Control over a root CA alone may be sufficient to disrupt Tier Zero operations, as the attacker can delete root CA certificates that Tier Zero principals or systems rely on for authentication. Root CA objects are therefore Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Schema Admins                           | FALSE        | AD group      | The Schema Admins group has full control over the AD schema. This allows the group members to create or modify ACEs for future AD objects. An attacker could grant full control to a compromised principal on any object type and wait for the next Tier Zero asset to be created, to then have a path to Tier Zero. This attack could be remediated by removing any unwanted ACEs on objects before they are promoted to Tier Zero, but we recommend considering the group as Tier Zero instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Security Administrator                  | TRUE         | Entra ID role | The Security Administrator role has access to Live Response API (if not disabled) with permission to execute scripts locally on Entra-managed devices. The role has therefore a potential attack path to Tier Zero through Entra-managed devices used by Tier Zero principals. Furthermore, the Security Administrator role can manage Conditional Access, which can be abused to lower the security of Tier Zero or prevent the operability of Tier Zero. The role is therefore considered Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Server Operators                        | TRUE         | DC group      | The Server Operators group has local privileges on the domain controllers and perform administrative operations as creating backups of all files. The group can log on locally on domain controllers by default.<br /><br />It is feasible to remove the logon privilege from the group on the domain controllers, such that the group has no known abusable path to Tier Zero. However, the local privileges are considered security dependencies for the domain controllers, and the groups are therefore considered Tier Zero.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
